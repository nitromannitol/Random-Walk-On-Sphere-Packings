# Measurability of stopped polygonal curves

For a finite discrete state space, an interpolation of fixed duration factors
through the finite prefix of that length. The measurable exit time selects
among these countably many measurable interpolations. This includes the
duration-zero convention at infinite exit time and uses no exit estimate.
